A meme generator written in python and served as a command-line tool and with flask!

## Dependencies

You can check the dependencies list int the [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) or in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

You have to install **xpdf command-line tool**. Check out [here](https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html) how to download and run xpdf.

For linux users: You don't have to install xpdf since it comes packaged with this repository!

Here's a dependecies list:

- python = "^3.8"
- python-docx = "^0.8.11"
- pandas = "^1.4.3"
- Pillow = "^9.1.1"
- requests = "^2.28.0"
- Flask = "^2.1.2"

### Poetry

If you use poetry just run `poetry install --no-dev` to install all dependencies.
A virtual environment will be created and all dependencies will be installed.

### Virtual Environment

To instantiate a virtual environment run the following commands:

`python3 -m venv .venv`

This will create a virtual environment in the **.venv** folder

Run `source ./venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.

Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.

## How to run

You can either run the **meme-generator** via the command-line tool or by running flask.

### Command-line instructions

After installing and activate the virtual environment run the following command to generate a random meme:

```
python meme.py
```

You can pass the following argumets:

- path: a path to a file.
- body: the body of the quote.
- author: the author of the quote.

you can pass arguments with the double dash!

Example:

```
python meme.py --body "To be or not to be" --author Shakespeare
```

### Browser

After installing and activate the virtual environment run the following command to spawn a flask server:

```
python app.py
```

This will create a link that you can click to inspect the meme generator via browser!
